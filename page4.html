            I’ll always remember that you liked me first.
            And i don’t think you realize how much that means to me.
            
            You were the brave one.
            You took the first step.
            You decided i was worth the risk.
            
            And because of that, i found someone who understands me,
            supports me,
            and makes my life brighter just by being in it.

            I feel so lucky that your heart chose mine first.
            And i promise, as long as I can,
            i will keep choosing you back
